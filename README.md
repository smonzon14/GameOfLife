# Conway's Game Of Life
Just one of many bored quarantine projects. Use "make" inside the repository directory and "./cgol" to run. Change the number of cells to be generated by changing the number right after FIELD_DIM to the number of cells in a row/column. SEED_DIM can be changed to anything less than or equal to FIELD_DIM so there is a cell deadzone at initialization.
